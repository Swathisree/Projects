# DNA-Sequence-Prediction
#### Sequence classification task: Predicting whether a DNA sequence region is binding site to a specific transcription factor or not
Transcription factors (TFs) are regulatory proteins that bind specific sequence motifs in the genome to activate or repress transcription of target genes. Genome-wide protein-DNA binding maps can be profiled using some experimental techniques and thus all genomics can be classified into two classes for a TF of interest: bound or unbound.  
This program works with three datasets corresponding to three different TFs. 
The dataset required to run the following project can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/advanced-learning-models-2018 (see the Installation instructions)
# How to get the copy of the project on local machine
